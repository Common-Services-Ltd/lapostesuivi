            <p>La Poste Suivi is an open-source module. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.</p>
            <p>To contribute to the project, you should ideally be familiar with Git, the source code management system that PrestaShop uses, with the official repository being hosted on Github:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can learn more about Git here: <a href="http://try.github.io/">http://try.github.io/</a> (there are many tutorials available on the Web).</li>
                <li>You can get help on Github here: <a href="https://help.github.com/">https://help.github.com/</a>.</li>
                <li>Windows users can get a nice interface for Git by installing TortoiseGit: <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/">https://tortoisegit.org/</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Contributors should follow the following process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create your Github account, if you do not have one already.</li>
                <li>Fork the La Poste Suivi project to your Github account.</li>
                <li>Clone your fork to your local machine.</li>
                <li>Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.</li>
                <li>Change the files in your branch. Be sure to follow <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Coding+Standards">the coding standards</a>.</li>
                <li>Push your changed branch to your fork in your Github account.</li>
                <li>Create a pull request for your changes on the PrestaShop project. Be sure to follow <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message">the commit message norm</a> in your pull request. If you need help to make a pull request, read the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Github help page about creating pull requests</a>.</li>
                <li>Wait for one of the core developers either to include your change in the codebase, or to comment on possible improvements you should make to your code.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That’s it: you have contributed to this open source project! Congratulations!</p>
            <p>The PrestaShop documentation features a thorough explanation of the <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop">complete process to your first pull request</a>.</p>
            <p>If you don’t feel comfortable forking the project or using Git, you can also either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edit a file directly within Github: browse to the target file, click the “Edit” button, make your changes in the editor then click on “Propose File Change”. Github will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own Github account, then suggest to create a pull request to PrestaShop. Once the pull request is submitted, you just have to wait for a core developer to answer you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thank you for your help !</p>
